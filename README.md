# Restaurant-Menu-and-Feedback-GUI

In this project, we created a python GUI using Tkinter Library.

In this Project. a customer can order either using the regular menu or a few questions are asked to the customer and based on the mood of the customer, a delightful cusisine is suggested to him/her.

After the order is done, a payment option is also provided.

And after that, a feedback form is provided to the customer.
